# Helpdesk Client

Helpdesk Client is a simple and effective tool that help you fill out your salary automatically while still allowing for custom changes. To summarize, you could call this project a sort of re-skin and improvement for primula.

It is available here as an executable file (see the releases tab for the lastest release), but then also via the website [PLANNED URL].

Also a big thanks to Eric for the help with the first beta test!

# Work in progress

This project is not finished, and therefore there might be features that may or may not work, so use at your own risk until v1.0 is released
